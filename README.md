# Maze Solver

Welcome to the Maze Solver project! This program is designed to tackle maze-solving challenges by employing a combination of sophisticated algorithms, including A* Search, Depth-First Search (DFS), and Breadth-First Search (BFS).

Special thanks to Ali Ahmed, Ahmed Ayman, and Mostafa Ahmed for their valuable contributions and assistance in this project.

## ⚙️ Algorithms Used:
Our maze-solving AI is equipped with a set of powerful algorithms to efficiently explore and find optimal paths. The A* Search algorithm intelligently balances heuristic information and cost to guide the search towards the most promising solutions. Meanwhile, DFS and BFS provide alternative approaches, offering insights into different problem-solving strategies.

## ⚡ Technologies Used:
Python
